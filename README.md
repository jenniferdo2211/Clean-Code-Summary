To understand the book "Clean Code" better, I wrote this note to learn it by hard way. Writing a note is like practicing it a bit and as a result, our brains can remember it better.<br />

This book, in my opinion, is just a reference but not the truth. We should not be dogmatic when applying rules and principles in this book.<br />

I personally recommend buying paperback version of this book rather than reading pdf version. It could help us concentrate better as our phones are oversimulating our brains, causing boredom and distraction everyday.<br />

Enjoy!
