# Clean Code Summary
### [Book] Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
### [Author] Robert C. Martin
### [Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code#other_reviews)

To understand the book better, I wrote this note to learn it by hard way. Writing a note is like practicing it a bit and our brain can remember it better.
This book, in my opinion, is just a reference but the truth. We should not be dogmatic when applying rules and principles in this book.
